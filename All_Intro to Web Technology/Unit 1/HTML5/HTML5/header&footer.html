It gives me an immense pleasure to lead the department of Information Technology. The motto of our department is to provide quality technical education to students, which will lead them sustain peaks in the field of technology. Department of Information Technology has labs equipped with high configuration machines and latest softwareâ€™s required for teaching/learning process and research. The department leads to empower students with quality education in the wide areas of information technology.
The department is loaded with competent faculty to teach advanced topics of Software Engineering, Cloud computing, Cyber security, Artificial Intelligence and so on. The faculty is actively engaged in research and publications as well. Thus we are confident enough that our Engineers will emerge as assets not only to this institution and to the organization, but also to the country at an extent. Along with academic knowledge we also train our Engineers to face the challenges in life by providing many value added courses to enhance their career prospects. The excellent infrastructure, teaching faculty of the best kind ensuring quality education such as interaction among students, parents and staff, along with the Training & Placement Cell ensuring a bright future to our students.
